# 7-Zip Modern Context Menu Extension

A standalone Windows 11 **modern context menu extension** for [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), built with the `IExplorerCommand` interface and packaged with MSIX.  

This project is **not a full fork of 7-Zip** ‚Äî it does not include the installer or core 7-Zip binaries.  
It is designed as a **companion** to an existing 7-Zip installation, adding a native Windows 11 style right-click menu similar to what NanaZip provides.

## ‚ú® Features
- Full set of classic 7-Zip right-click menu commands:
  - **Open archive**, **Extract files‚Ä¶**, **Extract Here (Smart)**, **Extract to ‚Äú<Folder>\\‚Äù**, **Add to archive‚Ä¶**, **Add to ‚Äú<Name>.7z‚Äù**, **Add to ‚Äú<Name>.zip‚Äù**, **Compress and email**, and CRC/SHA submenu.  
- **Smart Extract Here**: multiple archives extract into their own subfolders (avoids file mixing).  
- **Dynamic menu text**: e.g. `Add to "File.7z"`, `Extract to "Archive\\"`.  
- Root **‚Äú7-Zip‚Äù flyout** shows the 7-Zip icon; subcommands are clean text-only.  
- Works alongside the official 7-Zip install.
